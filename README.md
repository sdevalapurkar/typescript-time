# ðŸ¤– typescript-time

Demo project for a lunch and learn presentation about learning to use typescript.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/sdevalapurkar/typescript-time.git
```

2. Navigate into the app folder.
```
cd typescript-time
cd app
```

3. Install dependencies.
```
yarn install
```
Note: Make sure you have Node version >= 14 (ex: v14.19.0)

4. Run the app.
```
yarn start
```
Note: It may ask you to run on a different port if you already have something running on port 3000

## Practice

On this branch, the interfaces and setup for the app to function correctly with typescript have been removed. Trying to run the app as it is will not work.
The goal of this practice branch is to help you take a sample project and try to fix the issues that exist and get the application running.
